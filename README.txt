== Description ==
From WordPress 5.4 onwards, when accessing the WordPress administrator, we see that it does so in "full screen" mode by default and if you don't want to work that way, you can deactivate it, but it is very unusable, as well as confusing for novice users.

Therefore, if you want to get rid (yourself or your clients) of the annoying "full screen" of the WordPress administrator and get back to the default sidebar, with our "mowomo no default fullscreen mode" plugin you can now and very easily. 

Whenever you want to go back to full screen mode you can do it, don't worry.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin through the WordPress plugin panel.

2. Activate the plugin in the "Plugins" WordPress section.
